#Research how to make a database
#Look up how to make a music database (THE HARDEST THING TO DO ATP)  
# learning abotu different data structures but arrays are going to be consistent
# A file should be able to Open, be Read, and Close.
# Types of files included in text and binary
    #- text file: data encoded as text using ASCII ro UNIcode.
    # - binary file: data that hasn't been converted to text yet (need a text editor)

#Delimiters:  a predefined character or set of characters that mark the end of each piece of data
    #- It separates the different items within the files( if you get good at noticing and working w/ them, you can pull them like strings to get what you want)
# EOF or End of File markers: a special character or set of characters written to the end of the file ( used to be phrased as "\end")

#A record is a complete set of data abotu an item (like the list in a folder)

## Catch up on Chapter 6 to Chapter 10 (Turn in everything the way he wants it: flowchart, PseudoCode, Actual Code)

# Review Chapter 11 (We'll be going over that when we come back)
# Then Chapter 15 by the week after that
# All work needs to be done by the 24th and final projects
# Study for the Finals
